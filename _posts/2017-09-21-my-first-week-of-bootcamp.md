My First Week of Bootcamp
=========================
## Wait, What???.... Ahhh….

**The first week of bootcamp** has been a whirlwind of *oh cool*, *it’s giving me an error message*, *it’s not working*, *wait, what???*, and *yes, it works*. A very exciting, fast paced week with a generous dose of uncertainty mixed in. 

The biggest challenge for me this week was understanding the big picture of html and css. I was so focused on the details of setting up SASS, Gulp, Jekyll, and Github that I missed what was being conveyed… 

## These are some tools we can use to help us.

My first mistake was thinking that I needed to know the exact details of how to install and setup these tools. I thought I needed to know what files were installed when I ran `npm install `, where every semicolon was placed, every detailed etc., every detailed etc. What I failed to realize early on was that these were a small sample of the tools available. Understanding that you have to set up *a* tool was the more valuable take away.

>This what we have to think about and the type of tools we will need to complete this task. For this example we are using __insert specific tool here__ .

Understanding how to resolve issues and fix the things that are broken and the method for figuring all of that stuff out is so much more valuable that making sure I have the I have the syntax for this specific problem type correctly and written down in my notes.

It’s going to be fun and challenging during the remaining 11 weeks.
