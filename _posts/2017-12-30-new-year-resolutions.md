New Year Resolutions
=========================
 
 
The holidays and end of the year festivities always provide for a wide range of emotions in such a short period of time. There are the anxiety and joy of searching for ( and hopefully finding) the perfect Christmas gifts for friends or family. The anticipation of seeing those you haven’t seen all year. The enjoyment of indulging in all the wonderful foods and drinks. The regret of overindulging after stepping on the scale. Finally, celebrating the new year and reviewing the successes and missteps over the last year.

When I look back at last year, I had a whirlwind of a year. Plenty of ups and downs, and adding a new exciting chapter in my life and career as I made the change to web development. I have always treated my New Year resolutions as goals and this blog seems like a good place to write them out.

1. Attend 6 coding Meetup events in 2018.
    * a. Contribute something to at least 1 Meetup.


2. Write a blog post every week.
    * a. This goal will be pretty easy for the first few months as it is a requirement per the boot camp.However, it will be very challenging to keep up with writing weekly posts once I have a job. 


3. Read eight books on coding.
    * a. 2 books per quarter
    * b. The output is a blog post book report on what I’ve learned


4. Watch 24 talks (TED, coding, theory, whatever…).
    * a. 2 every month
    * b. The output is a blog post on the discussion topic.


5. Develop something new each month.

6. Complete 4 coding challenges every week (HackerRank, Exercism, etc.)

This should keep me busy for the next year.

Everyone have a happy and safe New Year.
