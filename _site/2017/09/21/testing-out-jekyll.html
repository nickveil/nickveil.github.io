<h2 id="wait-what-ahhh">Wait, What???…. Ahhh….</h2>

<p><strong>The first week of bootcamp</strong> has been a whirlwind of <em>oh cool</em>, <em>it’s giving me an error message</em>, <em>it’s not working</em>, <em>wait, what???</em>, and <em>yes, it works</em>. A very exciting, fast paced week with a generous dose of uncertainty mixed in.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for me this week was understanding the big picture of html and css. I was so focused on the details of setting up SASS, Gulp, Jekyll, and Github that I missed what was being conveyed…</p>

<h2 id="these-are-some-tools-we-can-use-to-help-us">These are some tools we can use to help us.</h2>

<p>My first mistake was thinking that I needed to know the exact details of how to install and setup these tools. I thought I needed to know what files were installed when I ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install </code>, where every semicolon was placed, every detailed etc., every detailed etc. What I failed to realize early on was that these were a small sample of the tools available. Understanding that you have to set up <em>a</em> tool was the more valuable take away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This what we have to think about and the type of tools we will need to complete this task. For this example we are using <strong>insert specific tool here</strong> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understanding how to resolve issues and fix the things that are broken and the method for figuring all of that stuff out is so much more valuable that making sure I have the I have the syntax for this specific problem type correctly and written down in my notes.</p>

<p>It’s going to be fun and challenging during the remaining 11 weeks.</p>
